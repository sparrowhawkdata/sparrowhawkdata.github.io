So props to them for making it a bit more intuitive.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to give it a few simple changes that will improve the readability by a lot.\nOriginal # See full sized chart. Problems # A standard line chart usually isn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice when visualizing rank. Some issues we can improve on:\nY-axis direction. People are used to interpreting line charts like this: a line going up is increasing, a line going down is decreasing. A rank that is decreasing in value is increasing in position (we want a lower value), so the line should be going up between 2020 and 2024. The direction of our y-axis should align with audience expectations. It\u0026rsquo;s not a hard fix \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s usually just a single check box to reverse y-axis direction in most charting software (and not much more difficult in anything code-based too). [To be fair, they did fix this by time I got around to writing this post!] The big problem with a line chart here is\u0026hellip; the line connecting the data points. The line slopes to imply an estimation of missing data points: we can\u0026rsquo;t observe all events, and we\u0026rsquo;re sort of predicting what the value might be between our observations. This is why there\u0026rsquo;s debate over whether it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to use curved/smoothed lines instead of straight ones \u0026ndash; it all comes down to how we think the audience will interpret the line shape. In this case, we have observed all events for our time period. There are no Summer Olympics happening in between our existing data points that we\u0026rsquo;ve missed. But a sloping line connecting the points might be taken to imply, for example, that Ireland\u0026rsquo;s rank was 25th in 2022, which is nonsense. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of chart clutter. Axis and grid lines, tick marks, and a y-axis label which isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary since every data point is directly labelled. The title is bland and purely descriptive. The data for Paris 2024 is incorrect: Ireland\u0026rsquo;s position was 19th, not 14th (but it\u0026rsquo;s possible this was true at the time of publication so I won\u0026rsquo;t be too hard here). Remake # See full sized chart. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s an immediately obvious chart type to use here, and I thought of a few different ideas before the final remake. Since our time series is really just a handful of points I can see the merits of a column chart or lollipop (one could argue this is totally appropriate since each observation could be considered a completely independent event, and this isn\u0026rsquo;t really a time series at all). However, this could be just as confusing, since we\u0026rsquo;d still need to invert the y-axis \u0026ndash; awkward on a column chart. A bump chart could work, but that might be awkward given the large changes in position and the fact we\u0026rsquo;re only plotting a single series. In the end, since the ranking only \u0026lsquo;changes\u0026rsquo; at distinct points, I thought a step chart would do the job.\nSo, I converted the line chart to a step chart. Now the line only moves straight up, down, left, or right, to the next obtained rank. The y-axis is inverted, so lower values (higher rank) are at the top. Combined with the step line, this sort of creates the outline of a bar chart with inverted data. It also resembles a the shape of a winners podium or pedestal, which I think is pretty neat! The title now contains a finding, instead of being purely descriptive. Further clarified that we have plotted Ireland\u0026rsquo;s rank by integrating the line colour into the title. Removed unnecessary chart clutter. Fixed the final data point. It\u0026rsquo;s possible there\u0026rsquo;s a better way to visualize this data; this approach just made the most sense to me at the time.

Data does not speak for itself.\nAll of this starts with your visualization\u0026rsquo;s title.\nAvoid vagueness. # We\u0026rsquo;re taught to create bland titles that describe a chart\u0026rsquo;s axes. All the way from elementary school, when we first encounter charts, to university, when we might be preparing original research for publication.\nStuff like this:\n\u0026ldquo;Fruit price over time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Caregiver age proportions by condition type.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Temperature vs. energy use.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Predictive margins of mental health.\u0026rdquo;\nAside from being completely unengaging, they leave the audience to \u0026lsquo;dig in\u0026rsquo; to the data on their own, and come to their own conclusion about what the visualization means. If you can even keep their attention that long.\nThe big problem here is that we have the curse of knowledge: experience and context we\u0026rsquo;ve gained from studying a topic or analyzing some data in depth, and which the audience simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t have. We have no idea whether our audience will see the same things that we do, or understand why those things are important.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t use vague, descriptive titles if you can avoid it.\nGive the takeaway. # Point out in plain language what the audience should remember about your viz.\nStudies demonstrate time and again that charts with a message in their title are recalled better than charts without one. Remember, your audience will spend more time on reading your chart text than on any other part, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to make it as easy for them as you can.\nTo reinforce this point: researchers at the Visual Thinking Lab found that charts with a takeaway message in their title are percieved as being more clear, professional, and trustworthy compared to other charts.\nData does not speak for itself. It\u0026rsquo;s an analysts role to analyze and form conclusions. Visualizations communicate conclusions. Don\u0026rsquo;t make us guess at the takeaway.\nGrab attention. # If requirements constrain you so that you can\u0026rsquo;t put the takeaway message in the title you need to grab and maintain attention some other way. You might use a flashy headline or pose an interesting question related to your visualization.\nThe European Correspondent often uses headlines in their visualizations (I even kept their headline in a Makeover post).\nOXD used a question to present a visualization on data-sharing experiences, and while I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with their choices it likely would have played well with their government audience.\nThe goal here is to draw the audience in long enough to communicate the message another way. Put the message in your subtitle. Point to the important findings with annotations.\nJust make sure you\u0026rsquo;re doing something to call attention to the visualization and get the point across quickly.\nKnow your audience. # Sometimes all of the research and best practices don\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nYour title might be limited by your audience\u0026rsquo;s expectations. That\u0026rsquo;s okay!\nMaybe you need to conform to the style conventions of a journal. By all means conform. But add a better title when it comes time to present the research elsewhere.\nOr perhaps you have a boss who is set in their ways. After asking you to do research and analysis to find the answer to some business question they suddenly need you to be \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; so they can find the answer in the visualization themselves. Some people are persistently \u0026lsquo;anti-editorializing\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; though I\u0026rsquo;d be quick to point out that communicating a finding and editorializing are not even close to being the same thing.\nSometimes the best you can do is nudge the culture in the direction of best practices bit by bit. It can take time, but developing a data-driven culture that isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid of good visualization is worth it!\nIn summary\u0026hellip; # Giving your data visualization a good title is probably the most important thing you can do to promote information recall. Research shows that charts with purely descriptive titles are forgettable.\nEnsure the main message or takeaway of your visualization is made clear in the title. In most cases you have a limited amount of time to make an impression on your audience, and this helps them interpret the viz quickly.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on the title, do your best to get the takeaway across in other ways.\nSee this post on Instagram! # View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sparrowhawk Data | Data Visualization (@sparrowhawkdata)\n","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/eodvs-titles/","section":"Posts","summary":"Most leaders in the data visualization space maintain that visualizations should have a clear, focused message.\nStephanie Evergreen (of Evergreen Data) says that we \u0026ldquo;visualize to communicate a point.\u0026rdquo; If we don\u0026rsquo;t have a point, why visualize?\nMike Bostock (of Observable, and d3.js fame) says good dataviz \u0026ldquo;should be opinionated.","title":"Elements of Dataviz Style: Crafting Good Titles","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/elements-of-style/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Elements of Style","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/title/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Title","type":"tags"},{"content":" See full sized chart.

For context, it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory for school districts in BC to submit enrolment projections as part of their budgetary and accountability framework.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of hard-to-read viz in the Fiscal Plan, but I\u0026rsquo;m picking on this one because of a major flaw.\nOriginal # See full sized chart. | Source. | Direct report link (PDF). Before jumping into what\u0026rsquo;s going wrong, I want to focus a bit on what\u0026rsquo;s going right. Someone at SD43 is trying, and, aside from the aforementioned flaw, this viz is actually doing a lot of things right in terms of improving readability. I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely seen a lot worse. I\u0026rsquo;ll give credit where credit is due.\nThey cleared some chart clutter by directly labelling each bar and removing the gridlines. The bars are a good thickness. There\u0026rsquo;s enough whitespace. Each year is easy to compare. I can see the trend easily. Good use of colour! They used a limited palette to focus our attention. The current year is highlighted, and a muted grey is used to differentiate the projections from the observed data. Very nice! Problems # But wait\u0026hellip; why does the 2022/23 bar look almost twice as tall as the 2021/22 bar? Enrolment certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t double. Ahh, there\u0026rsquo;s the rub.\nYou see, when we use a bar chart we\u0026rsquo;re visualizing and comparing length. Length is really easy to interpret, which is one reason bar charts are so common. It\u0026rsquo;s located high on Cleveland \u0026amp; McGill\u0026rsquo;s interpretation hierarchy, meaning it tends to result in few errors on the part of readers. But here, our y-axis doesn\u0026rsquo;t start at zero, so the length of the bar is only tangentially related to our data. So, the reader knows they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be comparing length, but we haven\u0026rsquo;t actually visualized length, leading them astray.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of debate in the data viz community about whether the y-axis should always start at zero. This is particularly true for line charts, and some others, when you\u0026rsquo;re visualizing data for which zero may not even be a realistic value. But for those charts our visual cues tend to be position or direction.\nFor bar charts, the axis absolutely must start at zero. If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for you, use a different chart type. The non-zero bar chart y-axis has been cited as a manipulation as far back as 1954 in How to Lie with Statistics. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a tactic used to purposefully mislead readers. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that was SD43\u0026rsquo;s plan here, but they probably don\u0026rsquo;t want to be in the same camp as those who use dataviz for evil.\nThis problem overshadows everything else about the visualization, by a long ways. Normally I\u0026rsquo;d point out that the y-axis labels are unnecessary (since the bars are directly labelled), but in this case they actually help us identify that there\u0026rsquo;s a problem with the scale! The title is bland, and so on. You know the routine.\nAlso, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use Calibri, just because it was the Office default typeface for so long.\nRemake # See full sized chart. So, we obviously need to change the chart type. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with that:\nI changed this from a bar chart to a line chart. The takeaway of this chart relates to the trend. We care about whether it\u0026rsquo;s going up or down. A line chart lets us see that without fundamentally being a manipulation. Zero isn\u0026rsquo;t a realistic value for FTE enrolment, and even relatively small changes are important (a 1% increase in a district this size is a lot of extra kids!), so it\u0026rsquo;s okay for us to display a \u0026lsquo;zoomed in\u0026rsquo; view. On that note, I leave the y-axis labels in to indicate the view is zoomed. The axis range is reasonable, allowing us to see the trend without overemphasizing the ups and downs (even a line chart can be manipulative, particularly if we stick to default axis ranges). I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s important that every data point in this visualization has a label, so I only labelled the important ones. This is okay, since we left those y-axis labels in. We\u0026rsquo;re left with answers to these burning questions: Where did we start? What was the pandemic impact? Where are we now? Where are we heading? I put the finding in the title, instead of using a boring description. Instead of using a separate legend, the legend information is integrated into the title. I used the same colours (teal for observed data, grey for projections), but tossed the current-year highlight (it\u0026rsquo;s not really necessary in the context of a line chart). The last three years are further emphasized as a projection via the broken, dotted line. Remember, it\u0026rsquo;s okay for a line chart to have a non-zero origin if you have a good justification, and I think it suits this data.\nSee it on Instagram! # View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sparrowhawk Data | Data Visualization (@sparrowhawkdata)\n","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-08-12-makeover-monday/","section":"Posts","summary":"I came across these enrolment projections from BC\u0026rsquo;s School District 43 (aka SD43) while working on another project.

Problems # A stacked bar chart like this is actually a pretty good choice for the kind of survey data they\u0026rsquo;re presenting. That said, there\u0026rsquo;s a few things I notice that we could improve on:\nThe title doesn\u0026rsquo;t give us any clear takeaway, other than experience varying by service type. Posing a question is better than something like \u0026ldquo;Data Sharing Experiences versus Service Type\u0026rdquo; though. At least it gives us a clue of what we should look for. The written points do point us to the big takeaway (sharing experiences are more negative than positive, and especially negative for police and housing). But it references survey question numbers, and no one but the analyst who dealt with the survey is going to remember exactly what those mean. Our finding is that experiences are likely to be negative, but the chart is focusing more on the positive experiences by placing those first. The agency/institution categories aren\u0026rsquo;t arranged in a meaningful order. I would guess this was the survey order. Our eyes have to jump around too much to compare the categories, and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to rank all but the largest and smallest values. The legend seems out of place. We could bring the legend marks closer to the categories they represent and make it more intuitive. Red and green together is usually a bad idea. These shades of red and green in particular are fairly close in colourblindness simulations. The white data labels have poor contrast against the green and grey bars. Remake # See full sized chart. Again, I focus on sharpening the message, as well as making the chart a bit more accessible.\nI put the main finding right in the title. Basically just shortened some of those written points and moved them to the top. The subtitle deals with the question number issue. I just summarized what was asked for the reader. I swapped the order of the sentiment categories, so we\u0026rsquo;re moving from negative to positive. Since the majority of experiences were negative we draw more attention to this. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of a huge finding to want to communicate, given the survey\u0026rsquo;s aim of improving ethnicity data collection! I sorted the agency/institution categories by negative sentiment (and then by neutral sentiment). Now the worst agencies or institutions to share data with are at the top (and presumably they get better as we go down). I split out and transformed the traditional legend, instead directly associating the labels with the bars. Now our eyes don\u0026rsquo;t need to dart around to the edge of the chart. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not intuitive that red means bad (this kind of symbolism is not even close to being culturally universal). I modified the colours, keeping the original red but lightening both the grey and green so the red has the most emphasis. I also added more blue to the green to help colourblind readers differentiate it from the red. I fixed the text contrast on the grey and green bars (they now use black text instead of white). I removed the vertical axis line and the horizontal axis labels. They were redundant chart clutter. Same chart, easier to read.

They also publish the annual Forest Pulse report, which covers forest loss over the last year.\nThey posted this chart to their Instagram page, and one user was confused about what was actually being measured. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping this makeover can give some clarity to the message.\nOriginal # See full sized chart. | Source. | Full report. Problems # Oh dear, more donut charts. And this time, they\u0026rsquo;re being used to make a comparison over time. Yikes! Donuts are not a great choice for that. Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down:\nFirst, as mentioned, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear what we\u0026rsquo;re measuring. What is \u0026lsquo;forest loss\u0026rsquo;? Our audience probably aren\u0026rsquo;t experts on the topic. I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not, yet this content was recommended to me. If Brazil\u0026rsquo;s forest loss went down in 2023 does this mean Brazil\u0026rsquo;s forests recovered? Or does it only mean they lost less forest that year compared to the year prior? (Hint: it\u0026rsquo;s the latter) Donuts are proportional. Did forest loss decline in Brazil, or did it just increase that much more in other countries? The title is super vague. Without the context of the full report, it\u0026rsquo;s not difficult to think of a bunch of ways to interpret the chart (as in the above two points). There is a point, but it\u0026rsquo;s in the Instagram description and the report body. It needs to be made explicit for scrollers and skimmers. Too many categories, too many colours, the labels are hard to read, and so on. The usual donut/pie problems. Remake # See full sized chart. The Forest Pulse report and the accompanying Instagram post (at least, the description) were emphasizing the huge declines in Brazil and Colombia\u0026rsquo;s annual tropical forest loss. Brazil\u0026rsquo;s annual loss is still very high, but there\u0026rsquo;s effort and it\u0026rsquo;s paying off. This is the message we want to sharpen.\nInstead of using raw numbers, I\u0026rsquo;ve transformed the data to show percentage change. For this topic, the raw numbers do seem to be very important, but the point of this chart seemed to be to show which direction different countries were moving. Brazil is a huge country with a lot of forest cover, and subsequently a lot of loss, but they are working to reduce that loss. Laos is a smaller country, but its forest loss is accelerating \u0026ndash; even though its annual loss is still well below Brazil\u0026rsquo;s. Percentage change allows a fair comparison; we can easily see where forest loss is improving and where it\u0026rsquo;s getting worse. This is a case where I\u0026rsquo;d ideally show both absolute and relative change. The original report does a pretty good job with absolute change, so I\u0026rsquo;m only focusing on sharpening the relative point. I convered the chart into a lollipop, and ordered the countries from low (negative) to high (positive). This creates a nice division between the improving countries and the worsening countries. I put the main finding right in the title. This is actually borrowed (and slightly modified) from elsewhere in the original report. I use the subtitle to clarify what was measured. It\u0026rsquo;s the change in annual loss, i.e. whether the amount lost in 2023 is more or less than the amount lost in 2022. I would test this with a few people who aren\u0026rsquo;t as stats-savvy and make it plainer if necessary, though. The remake is far less ambiguous to interpret, it\u0026rsquo;s way quicker to read, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to spend any time fishing for the message.\nSee it on Instagram! # View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sparrowhawk Data (@sparrowhawkdata)\n","date":"29 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-07-29-makeover-monday/","section":"Posts","summary":"I stumbled upon this donut chart by Global Forest Watch, which is a project of the World Resources Institute.

The title is completely descriptive and \u0026lsquo;academic sounding\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; there is no clear finding. This is a report to the public, not a scientific paper in a peer-reviewed journal. Tell us what we\u0026rsquo;re really looking at and why we should care. Each category actually belongs to one of three distinct, overarching themes (academic, mental health, overall well-being), but there is no indication of this in the visualization. There are too many colours, and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell where we should start looking. I\u0026rsquo;m drawn more to the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; category and its breakdown, which is not where our eyes should be (at least to start). It\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to see from the screenshot, but there\u0026rsquo;s a border box around the chart which prevents it from looking like an integrated part of the report. This is not a standalone viz, so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be trying to separate it off from the rest of the content. It should be part of the report flow. My biggest gripe is that the authors transformed the data in a confusing way in order to make it sum to 100% to fit a pie chart (credit where credit is due: at least the pie doesn\u0026rsquo;t sum to 960%). Instead of visualizing the percentage of student affairs professionals who \u0026rsquo;endorsed\u0026rsquo; each concern, they essentially summed up all of the concerns and visualized the percentage of that new denominator. We end up with a situation where \u0026lsquo;pandemic fatigue\u0026rsquo; makes up 9% of endorsed concerns, which looks pretty small considering it was endorsed by 87% of the surveyed student affairs professionals!\nThe original data they presented looked something like this:\nAcademic Mental Health Overall Well-Being Lack of in-person social connections with peers: 77% Anxiety not directly related to COVID-19: 84% Pandemic fatigue: 87% Online learning fatigue: 77% Social isolation: 83% Financial distress (or concerns about finances): 64% Motivation (e.g. difficulty getting started, staying motivated, completing work): 70% Loneliness: 61% Relationship issues with family, friends, romantic partners: 59% \u0026hellip;and so on. It is actually possible to visualize this sort of \u0026lsquo;multiple-selection\u0026rsquo; data. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy. And easier to understand, too.\nRemake # See full sized chart. I opted to scrap their data transformation and visualize the original table.\nI converted the chart from a \u0026lsquo;pie and column\u0026rsquo; to a lollipop chart. A lollipop is an excellent choice when you need to rank multi-select survey question options, and it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to read than a bar chart when you have a high number of categories with high numbers. This avoids the \u0026rsquo;too much ink\u0026rsquo; problem bar charts sometimes have. There\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of colour, and this ensures that the coloured dots grab attention quickly. The title has a point. There\u0026rsquo;s actually a finding we\u0026rsquo;re being pointed to, even if it\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious. Instead of random category colours, I used only three colours to code each category, showing its relation to the three overarching themes. Instead of a legend, these three theme colours are integrated into the chart title. I got rid of the border line. The report did not have a clear style to duplicate, so I went with a very simple report style. The viz should complement the rest of the report, not overshadow it. For typeface, the title, subtitle and source use Noto Serif, and other text uses Source Sans Pro.\nSee it on Instagram! # View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sparrowhawk Data (@sparrowhawkdata)\n","date":"22 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-07-22-makeover-monday/","section":"Posts","summary":"I was doing some digging on measures of mental wellbeing for a survey development project (it\u0026rsquo;s always good to stay up-to-date on current measures) when I came across a report on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Canadian post-secondary students.

These paintings date back to around 15,000 BCE.\nCurrent hypotheses for interpreting the art point toward the cyclical nature of the art: animals are always depicted in the same order with seasonal attributes, representing the march of time through the seasons.\nThis perspective is shared by archaeoastronomer Dr. Michael Rappenglueck of the University of Munich, who believes one painting in particular depicts the moon\u0026rsquo;s 29-day cycle. Additionally, a group of six dots above an aurochs in the \u0026lsquo;Hall of Bulls\u0026rsquo; bears a strong resemblance to the Pleiades star cluster, which is visible to the naked eye. Many ancient cultures had myths about the Pleiades, and the arrangement of the dots in Lascaux matches other ancient artwork and maps depicting the cluster. The Pleiades played an important role in the origin of astronomy, and its position in the sky was a reference point for a number of ancient calendars.\nLascaux painting of a horse (named \u0026lsquo;First Chinese Horse\u0026rsquo;) with line of 26 dots.

Other Caves. # Rudimentary star charts appear to exist in other European caves, such as La Tête-du-Lion Cave in France and the Cave of El Castillo in Spain. Some of these seem to depict the Pleiades again, and one resembles the Corona Borealis, a prominent constellation that is also a frequent topic of myth.\nCriticism. # Like with tally bones, when interpreting prehistoric art, we must be careful not to project modern ideas onto the people of the ancient world. The patterns in some cave paintings, and in many later artifacts, do appear to line up quite well with the brightest stars or other features of the night sky. It seems the stars, which shift with the seasons, may have been an important part of Upper Paleolithic culture, at least insofar as their movement heralds seasonal changes. However, much of this interpretation is hypothetical, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot we simply can\u0026rsquo;t know for sure.\nSee this post on Instagram! # View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sparrowhawk Data (@sparrowhawkdata)\n","date":"16 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/data-viztory-cave-star-charts/","section":"Posts","summary":"Join us as we explore the ways data have been visualized throughout history, from ancient times to the modern era.\nToday, we look at cave star charts, which are (hypothetically) rudimentary celestial maps found among Upper Paleolithic cave art!

Slope charts are great at demonstrating the direction of change, and this chart certainly makes the point that spending in (nearly) all countries has increased (not you, Iceland). The problem with slope charts is that they aren\u0026rsquo;t great at displaying relative change, especially when comparing vastly different quantities.\nFor example: in the following chart, the United States has one of the steeper slopes, but its spend per citizen was already quite large. That\u0026rsquo;s something like a 17% increase. Albania started and ended with a fairly small spend per citizen, and the line looks almost flat \u0026ndash; but it more than doubled in three years! Since countries have different economic circumstances and starting points, surely both the absolute and relative change are important here (especially with so much rhetoric about certain NATO countries not \u0026ldquo;pulling their weight\u0026rdquo;.)\nOriginal # See full sized chart. | Source.

Even though the original is measuring per capita spend, it hides the magnitude of change for countries that began with lower spending (and any comparison to the United States\u0026rsquo; military spending is going to be tough!).\nThere are some issues I\u0026rsquo;ll note here, though:\nThe takeaway message is in small text below the title and subtitle, and could be more prominent. The palette colours don\u0026rsquo;t provide enough contrast. Light yellow text on a grey background is pretty hard to read, and the European Correspondent does this in so many charts! I won\u0026rsquo;t be fixing the palette issue this time, since I\u0026rsquo;m going to attempt to duplicate their style, but want to note it in case anyone from their (excellent) data visualization team ends up reading this (fingers crosssed).\nRemake # See full sized chart. So, a ton of categories and a focus on relative change. This could have been something like a lollipop or dot plot (which from a baseline of 0% are nearly identical). But I wanted to try something new.\nA rundown of the changes:\nI calculated the percentage change and converted it from a slope chart to an arrow chart. Arrow charts are particularly good at displaying relative change, and the arrows make the direction of movement easy to understand. I don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of arrow charts, but they\u0026rsquo;re very similar to a comet chart. I like their clean appearance when dealing with many categories. I really liked the main title, so I left it. It\u0026rsquo;s very much the European Correspondent\u0026rsquo;s style to have a \u0026ldquo;catchy\u0026rdquo; title with the takeaway in the subtitle. However, this chart had a generic descriptive subtitle, with the takeaway in small text below the subtitle, so I moved the takeaway into the subtitle. I removed the legend and integrated it into the subtitle. I added a dotted gridline at the 50% mark, which helps ground the arrows. I added a red gridline at the 100% mark (finish line!) which calls attention to the secondary finding (some countries doubled their spending) without obscuring whether countries are meeting NATO\u0026rsquo;s spending target. I made this chart in Excel with no post-processing. I had never made an arrow chart in Excel before, and I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of any good tutorials on how to do it, so it was a bit tricky and time consuming to figure out a good approach. I started with a lollipop chart (which is itself a hacked scatterplot) and went from there. Even so, it took some thought and a lot of Ctrl-Z.

Can you tell at a glance? It looks large in comparison to the other slices because it is closest to us.\nStick to 2D charts.\nIf your data has multiple dimensions, don\u0026rsquo;t try to shove it into a 3D scatterplot or line (or rather, plane) chart. These are not easy to read (the one exception maybe being if we can actually view the chart in 3D).

You know those bar charts that grow and change rank as the years tick by? Or those line charts where the axes grow as the line moves? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to sit through 90 seconds of animation just get the point \u0026ndash; if there even is one.\nSometimes animation can help you tell the story.

The categories are way easier to compare. I simplified some of the labels. Often the language we use in a survey is not the ideal language for presentation. We\u0026rsquo;re not substantively changing the meaning by shortening the label, here. That said, depending on the audience, it can be a good idea to have more details on demand. Academic audiences, for example, tend to be more interested in exactly how the question was asked! The title now points to a finding of interest. There were multiple categories related to improving one\u0026rsquo;s financial situation (all of which easily fit into a typical financial planning strategy), and this seemed way more important than highlighting \u0026ldquo;saving\u0026rdquo; only. Only 11% of taxpayers planned to have fun with the money. I simplified the colours to reinforce the point and draw the eye toward the financially-oriented categories. I prefer to put \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo; at the end. They\u0026rsquo;re usually small categories and tend to be the most difficult to interpret. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen donuts with two toppings before, where maybe half is caramel and half is chocolate. Sounds too rich to have on the regular, but you\u0026rsquo;ve got to indulge now and then.

I worked this way for a long time, and my early charts were awful.\nIt turns out that following a few basic principles can take your charts a long way.\nFirst and foremost: choose a chart type that is appropriate for both your data and your audience.\nHave a point. # Good charts are opinionated. They don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the audience to find the finding on their own. Analyzing the data is your job.\nWhat matters to you, and what message do you need to get out there into the world? There are usually many different approaches to displaying the same data. Are you doing group comparisons? Looking at change over time? Using absolute or relative values? Or maybe rank order is most important?\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to say, why visualize in the first place? This is how most overcrowded pie charts are born.\nKnowing what you need to say can help lead you to the right chart.\nAvoid rules of thumb. # I don\u0026rsquo;t mean avoid rules altogether \u0026ndash; what\u0026rsquo;s the point of guiding principles otherwise \u0026ndash; but avoid the ones we were all told in school. The ones you learned from your grad school supervisor, who in turn learned from their grad school supervisor, who in turn learned\u0026hellip; you get the idea.\nThey can help you with the very basics. Stuff like this:\nRelationship Chart Type Time-series -\u0026gt; Line chart Comparison -\u0026gt; Bar chart Parts-of-a-whole -\u0026gt; Pie chart You probably won\u0026rsquo;t try to turn time-series data into a pie chart. Probably.\nBut these rules are too simple and have too many exceptions. Eventually they will hold you back.\nKnow your audience # This is a big one that people lose sight of easily. Are you making your viz for other data vizards? For scientists or domain experts? For the company\u0026rsquo;s C-suite? The general public?\nEach will have different data viz experience and expectations. There are too many dashboards designed by data vizards for other data vizards, when their audience was supposed to be general users. Experts want detail. The CEO might just want an actionable takeaway. The general public definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t want three decimal places and confidence intervals.\nComplex visualizations may be exactly what an analyst needs, but can leave other users completely lost.\nIf in doubt, simplify. # I know this is loaded advice. It tends to be a bit short on the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo;. This largely ties in to the previous point on audience.\nWhat I mean is: complex visualizations are often the most fun to design, and the most visually appealing, but they can also be the most daunting to interpret. If we can get our point across with a simpler visualization, or with a series of simpler visualizations, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s worth it to do this.\nThe fact is that simpler charts result in fewer interpretation errors (see Cleveland \u0026amp; McGill\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy). Position, length, and direction are the easiest visual information to interpret. Volume and curvature tend to be fairly difficult. Dot plots and bar charts are just easier to read than area charts and other more complex visualizations.\nCleveland \u0026amp; McGill\u0026rsquo;s Hierarchy Obviously we don\u0026rsquo;t want everything to be a bar chart, but if your viz isn\u0026rsquo;t working for your audience it\u0026rsquo;s time to take a step back and consider alternatives.\nAsk others. # It\u0026rsquo;s usually a good idea to ask someone else to interpret your visualization before releasing it out into the world. What is their main takeaway?\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s not the message you wanted, you still have some work to do.\nWorkshop different approaches and get early feedback from the intended audience if possible.\nJoin a data viz community to get the best feedback.

I rushed this out as a \u0026ldquo;here\u0026rsquo;s how to do this better\u0026rdquo; concept without paying much attention to polish or branding \u0026ndash; this was just about focusing the message of the visualization.\n","date":"1 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gallery/rural-connectivity-area-chart/","section":"Gallery","summary":"I redesigned a confusing pie chart into this area chart.","title":"'Rural Connectivity' Area Chart","type":"gallery"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/area/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Area","type":"tags"},{"content":"A friend linked me to a pie chart published by the Government of British Columbia on Instagram because they weren\u0026rsquo;t sure if they were interpreting it properly.

Problems # I think I can see what they were trying to do. The pie could be interpreted as getting \u0026lsquo;fuller\u0026rsquo; with each year. This concept could have worked better with a multi-layered donut chart, or by using progressively darker shades of gradient palette. Either approach is going to take too long to interpret.\nFrom top to bottom:\nThe title is vague and descriptive. It sounds like it came straight out of a scientific paper. The title should get straight to the point, especially on social media. Our eyes shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to go back and forth over a chart so we can figure out the message on our own. You\u0026rsquo;re the analyst \u0026ndash; tell me what you found. The legend category labels and the pie slice data labels appear to have been swapped. This would make the chart more difficult to interpret even if the rest of the chart was executed perfectly. The pie adds up to more than 100% and the slice proportions don\u0026rsquo;t appear to match the data. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind pie charts (a controversial outlook), but they are best used to demonstrate parts-of-a-whole relationships with only a few categories (maybe two or three). This chart makes it appear that 2017 had a greater value than 2024 and 2027 combined. The source of the data isn\u0026rsquo;t attributed. Where did the information come from? What\u0026rsquo;s the basis for the 2027 prediction? Remake # See full sized chart. When I remade this chart I wanted it to be as simple as possible \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;re targeting a government social media account, so you should be able to read and understand it quickly. I used large text and bold lines to ensure it could be seen easily on a small screen. I didn\u0026rsquo;t try to match the Government of British Columbia branding, but instead aimed to focus the message of the visualization (this was originally presented to a different audience).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the changes step by step:\nFirst, I converted it from a pie chart to an area chart. A line chart would do just as well, but an area provides a bit more visual interest than a single line. The trend is now pretty obvious: the percentage is going up with time. I tossed the descriptive title and replaced it with the main takeaway: \u0026ldquo;All rural households will have access to high-speed internet by 2027.\u0026rdquo; In this case it might be a goal or prediction, but this is the main message they want the audience to leave with. Now, if you only have someone\u0026rsquo;s attention for a few seconds at least they\u0026rsquo;ve heard you before scrolling away. I directly labeled the data points with their percentage value (not the year!). The years are not equally spaced, and the axis reflects this. Too often I see line charts without equidistant axis intervals. Projected data points are differentiated from observed data points using a broken line. We don\u0026rsquo;t actually know what percentage of rural households will have access to high speed internet in 2027 \u0026ndash; this is years from now. I found and provided the source for the information. Much more effective, right? Don\u0026rsquo;t use pie charts to show change over time, they have a bad enough rap as it is.\nSee it on Instagram! # View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sparrowhawk Data (@sparrowhawkdata)\n","date":"1 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-07-01-makeover-monday/","section":"Posts","summary":"A friend linked me to a pie chart published by the Government of British Columbia on Instagram because they weren\u0026rsquo;t sure if they were interpreting it properly.

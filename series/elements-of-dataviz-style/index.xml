      <description>Most leaders in the data visualization space maintain that visualizations should have a clear, focused message.
Stephanie Evergreen (of Evergreen Data) says that we &amp;ldquo;visualize to communicate a point.&amp;rdquo; If we don&amp;rsquo;t have a point, why visualize?
Mike Bostock (of Observable, and d3.js fame) says good dataviz &amp;ldquo;should be opinionated.</description>

      <description>I recently attended a talk by Steve Franconeri of the Visual Thinking Lab whose big takeaway was that &amp;ldquo;reading a graph is like reading a paragraph.&amp;rdquo; Even though graphs are visual, we rely on slow cognitive operations to process them. Recognition is quick, but comparison takes a lot more time.</description>

      <description>The more stuff we have in a chart, the longer it takes to read.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re working with Excel, Tableau, Observable, or ggplot2, by default charting software tends to add all sorts of extra elements like borders, gridlines, legends, and extra labels.
In other words, chart clutter.</description>

      <title>Elements of Dataviz Style: Keeping It Simple</title>

      <description>I frequently see charts with too many dimensions, 3D shapes, or awful tangentially-related clip art. Generally, artistic elements should be functional and we should avoid unnecessary complexity.
Now, complexity is fine. Often we simply fail at making complexity approachable.
Beauty is important (how else do we expect viz to catch the eye?</description>

      <description>Welcome to &amp;lsquo;Elements of Dataviz Style&amp;rsquo;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be distilling data visualization research and best practices down into guiding design principles.
We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen bad charts.
Chances are, their creators weren&amp;rsquo;t guided by any principles, but just figured things out as they went. I worked this way for a long time, and my early charts were awful.</description>

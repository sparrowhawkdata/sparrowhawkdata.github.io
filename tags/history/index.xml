      <description>Join us as we explore the ways data have been visualized throughout history, from ancient times to the modern era.
Today, we look at Indigenous beadwork, which was (and still is) used as a way to embed information and meaning into everyday objects. Beadwork is present in many cultures around the world, but the various Indigenous Peoples of North America have been creating beadwork for over 8,000 years (having its start around 6,500 BCE, as far as we know).</description>

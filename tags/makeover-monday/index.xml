      <description>A friend sent me this line chart, presumably published in the print edition of the Irish Times. They had the same chart published on their website with corrected data, and have since corrected the y-axis direction. So props to them for making it a bit more intuitive.</description>

      <description>I came across these enrolment projections from BC&amp;rsquo;s School District 43 (aka SD43) while working on another project. School districts are usually pretty bad at data viz, but really, who can blame them? It&amp;rsquo;s not like kids won&amp;rsquo;t go to school just because the district doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear communication strategy, and budgets tend to be on the tighter side.</description>

      <description>I found this stacked bar chart by Vancouver consulting firm OXD while working on another project. Since they do design consulting, OXD&amp;rsquo;s visualizations are usually pretty good, but I found this one took too long to read.
The visualization comes from the Anti-racism Online Engagement Report OXD developed for the Government of British Columbia.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon this donut chart by Global Forest Watch, which is a project of the World Resources Institute. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Global Forest Watch, they do a lot of dataviz related to forest cover, deforestation, forest fires, and climate change, much of which can be found in their dashboard.</description>

      <description>I was doing some digging on measures of mental wellbeing for a survey development project (it&amp;rsquo;s always good to stay up-to-date on current measures) when I came across a report on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Canadian post-secondary students. This was jointly published by the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) and the Canadian Association of Colleges and University Student Services (CACUSS).</description>

      <description>I saw this excellent slope chart from the European Correspondent while browsing Instagram, and wanted to remake the left side. Slope charts are great at demonstrating the direction of change, and this chart certainly makes the point that spending in (nearly) all countries has increased (not you, Iceland).</description>

      <description>I came across this chart just browsing Instagram and thought I could do better. The gold colour of the &amp;ldquo;put into savings&amp;rdquo; category calls attention to it quickly (&amp;ldquo;wow, only a quarter of Americans plan to save their refund?!&amp;rdquo;), but there&amp;rsquo;s a larger story here.</description>

      <description>A friend linked me to a pie chart published by the Government of British Columbia on Instagram because they weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if they were interpreting it properly. The confusion was certainly warranted. My first reaction: &amp;ldquo;Is this a parody account?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s not the impression you want your dataviz to have.</description>
